    "##Caveats for following the tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. These notebooks have been created and tested mainly on Jupyter notebook 3.2 and Python 2.7, but Python 3.4 should work equally fine, except for some profile utilities which will be seldom used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can follow the tutorial by re-playing the [provided notebooks](https://github.com/FrancescAlted/EuroPython2015/releases).  For thouse of you with problems with the Wifi, there are pendrives available.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **In case** you cannot reproduce the desired results in your own laptop, do not worry too much; my advice is that you just concentrate in tutor's explanations and ask in case something is not clear enough."
